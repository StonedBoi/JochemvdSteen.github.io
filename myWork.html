            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">Warpie's Mistake</p>
            <p>This was a group project where I worked together with artist students and a dev partner. Our decision was
                to go for an endless runner game with an extra time traveling mechanic where you need to switch
                appearance to blend in so they don't notify the Time God that's trying to get you for messing with time.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This game was made in Unity over the course of 8 weeks and I couldn't be more proud of it as I coded
                basically all the mechanics.</p>

            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">GameJam Project</p>
            <p>The first time I ever worked on a game was during a GameJam Project where the company 'Abstraction Games'
                send developers to our school and teach anyone who was interested the simple ways of making a game.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Together with their help I learned how to use Unity, and they're also the reason I am here today because
                it was this event that got me interested in becoming a game developer.</p>

            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">AR Target Practice</p>
            <p>This is a simple AR shooting game, the goal to use your phone to look around and shoot spiders that get
                spawned in. There are two modes: In one mode the spiders will simply spawn on pictures, this way you can
                have an irl setup. In the second mode the game will detect a surface and spawn the spiders on it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As this was the first I have worked on an AR project there are bound to be flaws but overall I am happy
                with the result and it's a great improvement for the future.</p>
