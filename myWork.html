            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">Warpie's Mistake</p>
            <p>This was a group project where I worked together with art students and a dev partner. Our decision was
                to go for an endless runner game with an extra time traveling mechanic where you need to switch
                appearance to blend in so they don't notify the Time God that's trying to get you for messing with time.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This game was made in Unity over the course of 8 weeks and I couldn't be more proud of it as I coded
                basically all the mechanics for an entire team.</p>

            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">GameJam Project</p>
            <p>The first time I ever worked on a game was during a GameJam Project where the company 'Abstraction Games'
                send developers to our school and teach anyone who was interested the simple ways of making a game. They
                gave us all the assets and even some example codes, which we used to make a top down shooter.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Together with their help I learned how to use Unity, and they're also the reason I am here today because
                it was this event that got me interested in becoming a game developer.</p>

            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">House of Horrors</p>
            <p>This is a ghost hunting game inspired by popular titles like Five Nights at Freddy's and Observation
                Duty. It is your job to search for the ghosts and exorcise them before they can wreak too much havoc.
                You have to select the proper tool for the right ghost, which can be identified either by their
                appearance, or by a certain effect they have in the visible camera.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>It was fun working on this, especially because a lot of the assets used were personally gathered by going
                around and taking our own pictures. It was also my first time working with post processing which made
                things look a lot nicer.</p>

    <div class="DOOM" id="DOOM" alt="DOOM project">
        <div class="WorksText2">
            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">DOOM Project</p>
            <p>This is a small project I decided to work on for fun. I wanted to make this because DOOM was one of the
                first games I had heard of and since it's a classic for starting game developers to make. Of course I
                didn't want to just entirely copy DOOM so I added some other gameplay aspect such as the collection of
                crystals from fallen enemies.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>It's a project I worked on solo for a couple weeks, in which I took time to learn to work more in depth
                with sprites, like having multiple angles. This was also my first proper attempt at making a first
                person shooter, so I was pretty happy with the result.

        <div class="WorksText1">
            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">AR Target Practice</p>
            <p>This is a simple AR shooting game, the goal to use your phone to look around and shoot spiders that get
                spawned in. There are two modes: In one mode the spiders will simply spawn on pictures, this way you can
                have an irl setup. In the second mode the game will detect a surface and spawn the spiders on it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As this was the first time I have worked on an AR project there are bound to be flaws but overall I am
                happy with the result and it's a great improvement for the future.</p>

    <div class="DeskSort" id="DeskSort" alt="Desk Sorting">
        <div class="WorksText2">
            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">Desk Sorting</p>
            <p>It's a really simple game, you are given a couple objects, and you can move them around on the big desk.
                You can rotate the items, change some of their colors, there's even a little note to leave a message on.
                This game doesn't really serve a special purpose, it was my part in a school collaboration work. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>What I found fun about this project was working with the collisions and rotations of the items, it was
                very tricky at first and they kept floating and clipping through objects, but I managed to turn it
                around and even add a stacking mechanic.
