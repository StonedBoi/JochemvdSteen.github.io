            <p style="font-size: 40px;">Arcade Project</p>
            <p>This was a group project where I worked together with artist students and a dev partner. Our decision was to go for an endless runner game with an extra time traveling mechanic where you need to switch appearance to blend in so they don't notify the Time God that's trying to get you for messing with time.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This game was made in Unity over the course of 8 weeks and at the time the creation I am most proud of due to the amazing teamwork my partner and the arists displayed.</p>

            <p>The first time I ever worked on a game was during a GameJam Project where the company 'Abstraction Games' send developers to our school and teach anyone who was interested the simple ways of making a game.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Together with their help I learned how to use Unity, and they're also the reason I am here today because it was this event that got me interested in becoming a game developer.</p>
