            <p>This was a group project where I worked together with artist students and a dev partner. Our decision was
                to go for an endless runner game with an extra time traveling mechanic where you need to switch
                appearance to blend in so they don't notify the Time God that's trying to get you for messing with time.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This game was made in Unity over the course of 8 weeks and I couldn't be more proud of it as I coded
                basically all the mechanics.</p>

            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">GameJam Project</p>
            <p>The first time I ever worked on a game was during a GameJam Project where the company 'Abstraction Games'
                send developers to our school and teach anyone who was interested the simple ways of making a game.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Together with their help I learned how to use Unity, and they're also the reason I am here today because
                it was this event that got me interested in becoming a game developer.</p>

        <div class="WorksText1">
            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">AR Target Practice</p>
            <p>This is a simple AR shooting game, the goal to use your phone to look around and shoot spiders that get
                spawned in. There are two modes: In one mode the spiders will simply spawn on pictures, this way you can
                have an irl setup. In the second mode the game will detect a surface and spawn the spiders on it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As this was the first I have worked on an AR project there are bound to be flaws but overall I am happy
                with the result and it's a great improvement for the future.</p>

        <div class="WorksText2">
            <p class="glow" style="font-size: 40px;">Silicon Evolution</p>
            <p>There's nothing too special about this game, it's a simple game where objects produce currency over time
                and you can combine two objects to make a better one which makes even more money.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I worked on the whole currency system and did some bug fixes here and there, but this was only possible
                due to the help of a more experienced developer in our team that was able to teach me new ways of
                coding. The reason I am bringing this up is because it's what I wish my future colleagues can be like.

            <p>In this Project we worked together with Nieuw Brabant Zuid-Oost to make a promotional app to bring more
                attention to local foods and where to get them. Our choice was to make an app that has a build in map
                with shows where all those places are but it also notifies you whenever you go past one.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I myself worked on the most important part of this app, that being the entire notification system,
                altough only for Android as we were only asked to make a prototype. For testing purposes we also made a
                playable version where you walk around using a joystick on the map.</p>
