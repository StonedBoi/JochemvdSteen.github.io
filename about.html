        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h2>
            Even though I've primarily studied software development, the thing I am most interested in is making games.
            This interest started when a game company came to my school and taught a select few
            students the art of making games.
            <br>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 75px;">EXPERIENCE</h1>
            <h2>
                So far I have worked with a couple different programs such as Unity, Visual Studio, GitHub and Pycharm
                as well as multiple coding languages like C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and React.

        <h1>SKILLS</h1>
        <h2>
            Things I am most preficient in are Unity and C# because of all the game projects I work
            on for both school and work, and although limited, I still have some understanding of Python.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sadly I am still inexperienced in areas like SQL, HTML and mostly other things related to web.
        </h2>
        <h1 style="margin-top: 75px;">GOALS</h1>
        <h2>For the future my main goal is to become a game developer, but I'm still interested in other forms of
            programming.
            <br>
            I want to try learning more programs like Unreal, and also more coding languages such as C++.
            <br>
            But above all, I want to give the people entertainment.
