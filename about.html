        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h2>
            Even though I am doing software development my main reason for joining this course was because I have an
            interest in making games.
            This interest started when a game company worked together with my previous school and thought a select few
            students the art of making games.

            <h1 style="margin-top: 75px;">EXPERIENCE</h1>
            <h2>
                So far I have worked with a couple different programs such as Unity, Visual Studio, GitHub and Pycharm
                as well as multiple coding languages like C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript and SQL.

        <h1>SKILLS</h1>
        <h2>
            So far the things I am most preficient in are mostly Unity and C# because of all the game projects I work
            on, but I can still do good with what knowledge I do have of Python.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sadly I am still weak in areas like SQL, HTML and mostly other things used
            for webpages and other online data.
            This can be seen in the Portfolio you are looking at right now.
        </h2>
        <h1 style="margin-top: 75px;">GOALS</h1>
        <h2>For the future my main goal is to become a game developer, wether it be in a small or big company.
            <br>
            I want to try learning more programs like Unreal as well.
            <br>
            But above all, I want to make some gamers out there happy.
